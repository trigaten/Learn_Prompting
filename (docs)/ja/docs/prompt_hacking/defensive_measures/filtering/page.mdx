# 🟢 Filtering

Filtering is a common technique for preventing prompt hacking(@kang2023exploiting). There are a few types of filtering, but the basic idea is to check for words and phrase in the initial prompt or the output that should be blocked. You can use a blocklist or an allowlist for this purpose(@selvi2022exploring). A blocklist is a list of words and phrases that should be blocked, and an allowlist is a list of words and phrases that should be allowed.
