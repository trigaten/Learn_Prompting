            Task: You're designing prompts for an AI model to serve as an automated customer support for an e-commerce platform responsible for helping customers process returns for items they’ve purchased.
            <ol>
                <li>Define the problem scenario. The user reports, "I want to return the shoes I bought. How do I do it?"</li>
                <li>Identify the role the AI model needs to play. In this case, the model will act as a customer service representative.</li>
                <li>Formulate the prompt for the AI model. This will need to incorporate both the problem scenario and the role.</li>
