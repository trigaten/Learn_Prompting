# 🟢 이메일 쓰기

이메일 작성은 시간이 많이 걸리는 작업일 수 있으며, 특히 처음 받아본 이메일을 읽어봐야 할 때는 더욱 그렇습니다. 이 섹션에서는 상사에게 오늘 아프다는 간단한 이메일부터 보다 복잡한 콜드 리드 이메일에 이르기까지 다양한 사용 사례를 다룹니다.


## 아픈 날 보내는 기본적인 메일

여러분이 아파서 회사에 가지 못한다고 생각해보세요(아니면 가기 싫어서😈). 여기 상사에게 여러분이 아프다는 것을 말하는 이메일을 작성하는 간단한 프롬프트가 있습니다.

<div trydyno-embed="" openai-model="text-davinci-003" initial-prompt="My Name: Mario\nBoss's name: John\n\nWrite an email to my boss saying that I will be out of office today since I am sick. " initial-response="Subject: Out of Office - Sick\n\nDear John,\n\nI am writing to inform you that I will be out of office today due to illness. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nI will be sure to keep you updated on my progress and will be back in the office as soon as I am feeling better.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nSincerely,\nMario" max-tokens="256" box-rows="8" model-temp="0" top-p="0">

</div>

이 이메일은 훌륭하지만 꽤 따분합니다. 조금 더 재미있게 만들어 봅시다!

## 스타일 수정 및 지시

이메일의 스타일을 수정하는 방법은 매우 간단합니다. 예를 들어, AI에게 '유머러스하게'라고 요청하거나 '재미있는 이유를 포함하라'고 지시할 수 있습니다.

<div trydyno-embed="" openai-model="text-davinci-003" initial-prompt="My Name: Mario\nBoss's name: John\n\nWrite a humorous yet professional email to my boss saying that I will be out of office today since I am sick. \nBe concise and funny. Include a funny reason:" initial-response="Dear John,\n\nI'm writing to let you know that I will be out of office today. I know I'm supposed to be working, but I just couldn't resist the call of the siren song of the local donut shop. I'm sure you understand.\n\nI'll be back in the office tomorrow and will make up the time.\n\nThanks,\nMario" max-tokens="256" box-rows="10" model-temp="0.7" top-p="1">

여기 좀 더 진지하고 전문적인 또 다른 예제가 있습니다.

<div trydyno-embed="" openai-model="text-davinci-003" initial-prompt="My Name: Mario\nBoss's name: John\n\nWrite a **serious**, professional email to my boss saying that I will be out of office today since I am sick. \nBe concise:" initial-response="Subject: Out of Office - Sick\n\nDear John,\n\nI am writing to inform you that I will be out of office today due to illness. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nSincerely,\nMario" max-tokens="256" box-rows="8" model-temp="0" top-p="0">

## 이메일 대답하기

상사로부터 많은 정보가 담긴 긴 이메일을 받았다고 상상해 보세요. 이메일에 답장을 보내야 하지만 전체를 다 읽을 시간이 없습니다. 이메일을 AI에 연결하여 요약과 실행 항목 목록을 생성(`Generate a summary of this and a list of action items`)하도록 요청할 수 있습니다.

<div trydyno-embed="" openai-model="text-davinci-003" initial-prompt="Dear Mario,\n\nI hope you're doing well. I am writing to provide you with some updates on our company and to request your assistance in addressing an issue with the user interface (UI) of the software you have been working on.\n\nAs you know, our company has been focusing on providing a user-friendly experience to our customers, and we have identified some issues with the UI of the software.

This may involve making changes to the layout, design, or functionality of the UI. We believe that your expertise in software development and your familiarity with the software will make you the ideal person to help us with this task.\n\nIf you need any additional resources or support to complete this task, please do not hesitate to let me know. Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide me with an estimated timeline for when you expect these modifications to be completed.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nThank you for your hard work and dedication to our company. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\n\nGenerate a summary of this and a list of action items." initial-response="Summary: John is requesting Mario's assistance in addressing user interface issues with the software Mario has been working on. The issues involve difficulty accessing certain features and the UI not being intuitive enough. Mario's expertise in software development and familiarity with the software make him the ideal person to help with this task.\n\nAction Items:\n- Make changes to the layout, design, or functionality of the UI\n- Request additional resources or support if needed\n- Provide an estimated timeline for completion of modifications" max-tokens="256" box-rows="18" model-temp="0" top-p="0">

<br/>여러분은 이 요약을 답변 이메일 쓰는 데 활용할 수 있을 겁니다.

<br/>이 두 단계를 합쳐서 하나로 만들 수 있다는 점을 참고하세요. 우리는 AI에 이메일을 받고 바로 그 답변 이메일을 생성하도록 시킬 수도 있습니다.

## 콜드 이메일

콜드 이메일은 여러분이 모르는 사람에게 이메일을 보내는 것입니다. 콜드 이메일로부터 답변을 얻어내는 것은 상당히 어렵습니다 하지만 다양한 사람들에게 맞춤형 메시지를 보내는 데는 도움이 될 것입니다. GPT-3(@bonta2022how)를 이용해서 어떻게 하는지 살펴봅시다.

<div trydyno-embed="" openai-model="text-davinci-003" initial-prompt="Company name: Bark Inc\nMy name: Mike\nWrite a cold outreach email" initial-response="Dear John,\n\nI'm writing to let you know that I will be out of office today. I know I'm supposed to be working, but I just couldn't resist the call of the siren song of the local donut shop. I'm sure you understand.\n\nI'll be back in the office tomorrow and will make up the time.\n\nThanks,\nZach" max-tokens="256" box-rows="10" model-temp="0" top-p="0">

꽤나 정돈되어 있지만 우리는 더 잘할 수 있습니다. 프롬프트에 몇가지 정보를 추가합니다.

### 구조화 되지 않은 정보 사용하기

여러분이 이메일 보내야 할 사람의 링크드인 프로필을 알고 있다고 해봅시다. 우리는 이메일을 더 개인 맟춤으로 만들기 위해서 프롬프트에 정보를 추가할 수 있을 것입니다. [Strive 창업자의 LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/snpranav/)를 예시로 사용해봅시다. 우리는 그의 프로필에서 많은 정보를 얻을 수 있고 또한 프롬프트에 추가할 수도 있습니다.
