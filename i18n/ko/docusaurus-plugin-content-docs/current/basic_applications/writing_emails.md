# 🟢 이메일 쓰기

이메일을 쓰는 것은 시간을 많이 쓰는 일이기도 하고 특히나 여러분이 처음 받아보는 이메일이라면 더욱 그렇습니다. 이 섹션은 여러분이 오늘 아프다는 것을 상사에게 말하는 이메일 부터 더 복잡한 콜드 메일까지 알려줄 것입니다.


## 아픈 날 보내는 기본적인 메일

여러분이 아파서 회사에 가지 못한다고 생각해보세요(아니면 가기 싫어서😈). 여기 상사에게 여러분이 아프다는 것을 말하는 이메일을 작성하는 간단한 프롬프트가 있습니다. 

<div trydyno-embed="" openai-model="text-davinci-003" initial-prompt="My Name: Mario\nBoss's name: John\n\nWrite an email to my boss saying that I will be out of office today since I am sick. " initial-response="Subject: Out of Office - Sick\n\nDear John,\n\nI am writing to inform you that I will be out of office today due to illness. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nI will be sure to keep you updated on my progress and will be back in the office as soon as I am feeling better.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nSincerely,\nMario" max-tokens="256" box-rows="8" model-temp="0" top-p="0">

</div>

이 이메일은 괜찮지만 좀 지루합니다. 조금 양념을 칠 필요가 있을 것 같습니다!

## 스타일 수정 및 지시

이메일의 스타일 을 바꾸는 것은 정말 쉬운 일입니다. 예를 들어 여러분이 AI에게 'humorous' 또는 'Include a funny reason'등을 지시할 수도 있습니다.

<div trydyno-embed="" openai-model="text-davinci-003" initial-prompt="My Name: Mario\nBoss's name: John\n\nWrite a humorous yet professional email to my boss saying that I will be out of office today since I am sick. \nBe concise and funny. Include a funny reason:" initial-response="Dear John,\n\nI'm writing to let you know that I will be out of office today. I know I'm supposed to be working, but I just couldn't resist the call of the siren song of the local donut shop. I'm sure you understand.\n\nI'll be back in the office tomorrow and will make up the time.\n\nThanks,\nMario" max-tokens="256" box-rows="10" model-temp="0.7" top-p="1">

<br/>

여기 좀 더 진지하고 전문가적인 예제가 있습니다.

<div trydyno-embed="" openai-model="text-davinci-003" initial-prompt="My Name: Mario\nBoss's name: John\n\nWrite a **serious**, professional email to my boss saying that I will be out of office today since I am sick. \nBe concise:" initial-response="Subject: Out of Office - Sick\n\nDear John,\n\nI am writing to inform you that I will be out of office today due to illness. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nSincerely,\nMario" max-tokens="256" box-rows="8" model-temp="0" top-p="0">

## 이메일 대답하기

여러분의 상사로부터 긴 이메일을 받았다고 생각해봅시다. 여러분은 이메일에 꼭 답해야 합니다. 하지만 전체를 읽을 시간을 없습니다. 그렇다면 여러분은 `Generate a summary of this and a list of action items`이라고 질문할 필요가 있습니다.

<div trydyno-embed="" openai-model="text-davinci-003" initial-prompt="Dear Mario,\n\nI hope you're doing well.

<br/>여러분은 이 요약을 답변 이메일 쓰는 데 활용할 수 있을 겁니다.

<br/>이 두 단계를 합쳐서 하나로 만들 수 있다는 점을 참고하세요. 우리는 AI에 이메일을 받고 바로 그 답변 이메일을 생성하도록 시킬 수도 있습니다.

## 콜드 이메일

콜드 이메일은 여러분이 모르는 사람에게 이메일을 보내는 것입니다. 콜드 이메일로부터 답변을 얻어내는 것은 상당히 어렵습니다 하지만 다양한 사람들에게 맞춤형 메시지를 보내는 데는 도움이 될 것입니다. GPT-3(@bonta2022how)를 통해서 어떻게 하는지 살펴봅시다.

<div trydyno-embed="" openai-model="text-davinci-003" initial-prompt="Company name: Bark Inc\nMy name: Mike\nWrite a cold outreach email" initial-response="Dear John,\n\nI'm writing to let you know that I will be out of office today.

꽤나 정돈되어 있지만 우리는 더 잘할 수 있습니다. 프롬프트에 몇가지 정보를 추가합니다.

### 구조화 되지 않은 정보 사용하기

여러분이 이메일 보내야 할 사람의 링크드인 프로필을 알고 있다고 해봅시다. 우리는 이메일을 더 개인 맟춤으로 만들기 위해서 프롬프트에 정보를 추가할 수 있을 것입니다. [Strive 창업자의 LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/snpranav/)를 예시로 사용해봅시다. 우리는 그의 프로필에서 많은 정보를 얻을 수 있고 또한 프롬프트에 추가할 수도 있습니다.
