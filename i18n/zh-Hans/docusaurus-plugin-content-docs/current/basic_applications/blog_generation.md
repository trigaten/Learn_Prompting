# 🟢 博客

如果你可以在5秒钟内写一篇博客文章，那会怎么样呢？

说实话，你不能。但是，人工智能确实可以 **显著** 减少写博客文章所需的时间。

本页介绍如何使用人工智能来帮助写博客。这个过程可以迭代：你应该学会写提示词，查看模型输出结果，取出输出的部分，然后重复这个过程。

例如，假设你在一个托儿所工作，正在起草一篇关于“为什么圣诞仙人掌值得买”的文章。我总是喜欢从大纲开始创作，所以让我们从以下提示词开始吧：

```text
Write an outline for a short blog post about why Christmas Cacti are a great buy.

here are many products which attempt to do this, but you can often get consistent results doing it yourself. 

// highlight-start
I. Introduction
A. Overview of Christmas Cacti
B. Benefits of owning a Christmas Cacti

II. Christmas Cacti Are Affordable
A. Cost of Christmas Cacti
B. Comparison to Other Houseplants

III. Christmas Cacti Have Long Lifespans
A. Average Lifespan of Christmas Cacti
B. Low Maintenance Requirements

IV. Christmas Cacti Make Great Gifts
A. Unique Color and Shape of Blooms
B. Easy to Care for and Long Lasting

V. Conclusion
A. Summary of Benefits of Owning a Christmas Cacti 
B. Where to Find a Christmas Cacti 
C. Suggestions for Care and Maintenance

//highlight-end
```


哇，结果相当详细全面。也许我们想要一篇略微简短的文章，所以让我们请求AI使用这个提示词来写一篇更短的版本。


```text
That's a great outline, but a bit long. Condense it to the main points:
```

:::注意
我们假设你正在使用ChatGPT（如果不是ChatGPT，记得在这个新提示前面先写上大纲）。

模型输出结果如下：

B. Long Lifespan

III. Conclusion

完美！现在让我们请求它使用这个大纲来写一篇完整的博客文章：

```text
Write a short blog post using this outline about why Christmas Cacti are a great buy.

// highlight-start
Christmas Cacti are a great buy for the holiday season! They are an affordable and long-lasting option that make great gifts. Christmas Cacti are easy to find in most garden and plant stores, and they range in price from a few dollars to more expensive, depending on the size and shape of the plant.

These plants are also known for their long lifespan. If cared for properly, they can last for many years, providing your friends and family with an evergreen reminder of the holiday spirit. Christmas Cacti are fairly low maintenance and require minimal care, making them a great option for someone who does not have a lot of experience with plants. They should be placed in a bright and sunny spot, watered regularly, and given plant food every month or so. 

Overall, Christmas Cacti are a great buy for the holidays. They are affordable, have a long lifespan, and make great gifts. With minimal care and attention, these plants can provide a beautiful reminder of the holiday season for years to come.

好的，生成的内容看起来相当不错。我们可能还想在圣诞仙人掌的定价和公司的信息方面添加一些内容，因此让我们使用以下提示词：


```text
Perfect! Add a paragraph at the end about our company and pricing on Christmas Cacti.
Company: Prickly Point Nursery
Price for a Christmas Cacti: $10-$25
```

以下是模型生成的内容：

呐，这篇小博客看起来就顺眼多了！

当作者撰写内容时，我通常只使用ChatGPT或GPT-3，但还有许多其他工具可以帮助你写博客，比如[Jasper.ai](https://www.jasper.ai/) 和 [Copy.ai](https://www.copy.ai/)。 它们通常在幕后依赖GPT-3技术，但它们有许多其他功能可以帮助你写内容。

## 额外知识点

- 人工智能可以帮助你在相对短的时间内撰写高质量的博客文章，这比你自己写需要花费更少的时间。这个过程并非完全自动化，因此需要你积极参与其中。
