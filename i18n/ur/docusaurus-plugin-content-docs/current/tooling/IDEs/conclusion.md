# Conclusion

This page will be updated as I get access to more IDEs. 

This chapter has provided an overview of some of the tools which may be of interest to
you as a prompt engineer. Below are my recommendations for which to use, and in 
what capacity. Keep in mind that prompt engineering is a rapidly evolving field, and
many of the previously mentioned tools will undergo signifigant changes in the future.

## For Single Prompt Iterating

Everyprompt seems to have the best feature set for single prompt iterating (from the IDEs I have been able to try). Regular playground is also good, and a bit simpler.

## For Prompt Chaining

Dust is currently the best (less technical) tool for prompt chaining. It provides a very 
robust feature set.


## Embeds

Dyno is the only tool which offers an embed.

## For Full Control

Langchain is the way to go! It is a Python library, so it is fully extensible, 
and already comes with a great feature set.


## More

I will be adding more recommendations as I get access to more IDEs. I recommend 
trying out different ones, as each has a distinct feel and different features.
