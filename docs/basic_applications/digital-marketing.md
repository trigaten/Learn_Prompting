# ðŸŸ¡ Digital Marketing

Your favorite AI chatbot is a treasure chest of resources for both the mundane and the nuanced work of digital marketing, from analysis to content generation to tweaking. In this article we look at:
* keyword research
* marketing channel research and brainstorming
* tweaking content on pages and PPC ads
* social media influencers and hashtags
* creating prompts to generate an image to accompany a blog or post
* technical SEO


## Keyword Research

Ask your preferred AI chatbot what keyword variants exist for a main keyword, and ask for more detail:
* Generate a list of keywords related to pez dispensers.
* Generate a list of long-tail keywords related to pez dispensers.
* Generate a cluster of keywords related to pez dispensers, and organize with column headings for the cluster, the keyword, and the search intent.


Try it for your keyword:

<div 
trydyno-embed="" 
openai-model="text-davinci-003" 
initial-prompt="Act as a senior SEO consultant. Generate a list of long-tail keywords related to pez dispensers." 
initial-response="" 
max-tokens="512" 
box-rows="5" 
model-temp="0.0" 
top-p="0">
    <noscript>Failed to load Dyno Embed: JavaScript must be enabled</noscript>
</div>

The output ought to something like:

```text
As a senior SEO consultant, I understand the importance of targeting long-tail keywords to drive targeted traffic and improve search engine rankings. Here's a list of long-tail keywords related to Pez dispensers:

"Rare vintage Pez dispensers for sale"
"Collectible Pez dispensers from the 1990s"
"Limited edition Pez dispensers with original packaging"
"Disney character Pez dispensers for collectors"
"Superhero Pez dispensers with complete sets"
etc.
```
