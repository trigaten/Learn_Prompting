# üü¢ Summarizing Text

ChatGPT is notorious for producing content in the blink of an eye, and has proven to be a huge time saver.
For content already written, ChatGPT can also save us time by helping us digest long torturous texts.  
It can summarize books, movies, plays, articles and many more. With ChatGPT, it‚Äôs like having a Cliff‚Äôs Notes‚Ä¶ON EVERYTHING!

## Summarizing from Scratch

Sometimes, you can ask ChatGPT to summarize famous works without pasting in any additional text, since ChatGPT knows the works so well. For example, you can ask it to summarize ‚ÄúRomeo & Juliet‚Äù by act. So, instead of slogging through the 24,000 words of the play, you can get the gist in 300 or less. 


import outline1 from '@site/docs/assets/basic_applications/summarizing/Romeo_and_Juliet_Act_by_Act_1.webp';
import quantum from '@site/docs/assets/basic_applications/summarizing/Quantum_Entanglement.webp';

import rope from '@site/docs/assets/basic_applications/summarizing/Outline_1.webp';
import rope2 from '@site/docs/assets/basic_applications/summarizing/Outline_2.webp';

<div style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>
  <img src={outline1} style={{width: "750px"}}/>
</div>

Although you could instead look up a summary, ChatGPT can tailor the content to your needs. Maybe you really like Football, so you could as ChatGPT to
‚ÄúGive me a 100 word summary of ‚ÄòRomeo and Juliet‚Äô in American football terms.‚Äù

## Working With Long Blocks of Texts: Copy & Paste!

You can ask ChatGPT to summarize or create an outline of the text and TL;DR the whole thing. All you have to do is copy and paste the specific text into the prompt. (You can include up to 2,500 words. If the work is longer than that, you will have to break it into chunks.)
Ask for a simplified summary of chosen text by writing, ‚ÄúSummarize this for me like I'm 5 years old: [PASTE TEXT HERE]‚Äù 
This one is a summary ‚Äúfor a 5-year old‚Äù from a section of Wikipedia‚Äôs entry on ‚Äú[quantum entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement#:~:text=vte-,Quantum%20entanglement,-is%20the%20phenomenon)‚Äù. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>
  <LazyLoadImage src={quantum} style={{width: "750px"}} />
</div>

In addition to summaries, you can also ask ChatGPT to write outlines for blocks of text. Sometimes it‚Äôs better to have an outline so that you can see the thread or framework of the whole article. 
You also just need to copy and paste the text you want outlined into your prompt.   
The following is ChatGPT‚Äôs outline on the Wikipedia page on ‚Äúrope,‚Äù specifically on the history of [rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope#:~:text=to%20pull%20ropes.-,History,-Ancient%20Egyptians%20were).

<div style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>
  <LazyLoadImage src={rope} style={{width: "750px"}} />
</div>

<div style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>
  <LazyLoadImage src={rope2} style={{width: "750px"}} />
</div>

We‚Äôve just covered some of the very basics of using ChatGPT to handle long texts. There are many more ways to use ChatGPT to summarize and outline texts!
