# üü¢ Different Voices, Different Choices

AIs like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) are known for crafting essays and blog articles in a heartbeat. But often, the articles they produce are generic and dry. You need to do something extra to give the words some spirit or pizzazz. 
One of the fastest ways to do that is to specify a writing style or naming a famous author in the prompt.     
Say you want a paragraph on the importance of friendship. 
A generic prompt like, ‚ÄúWrite me a paragraph on the importance of friendship,‚Äù will yield a generic response from ChatGPT.  

import friendship from '../assets/basic_applications/Generic_Friendship.png';
import friendship_informal from '../assets/basic_applications/Friendship_Informal.png';
import friendship_mark from '../assets/basic_applications/Friendship_Mark_Twain.png';
import friendship_chris from '../assets/basic_applications/Friendship_Chris_Rock.png';
import friendship_millennial from '../assets/basic_applications/Friendship_Millennial.png';


<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={friendship} style={{width: "750px"}} />
</div>

Blah. It‚Äôs so bland. 
Results change when you add specifications, like ‚Äú**Please write in an informal, conversational style.**‚Äù ChatGPT comes up with something like this:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={friendship_informal} style={{width: "750px"}} />
</div>

That‚Äôs a little better. 

And if you feel a little fancy, you can ask ChatGPT to write in the style of one of the literary greats, like Mark Twain:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={friendship_mark} style={{width: "750px"}} />
</div>

The text now is starting to sing.
But it doesn‚Äôt have to be a famous author. You can use well-known individuals as well‚Äîlike Chris Rock. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={friendship_chris} style={{width: "750px"}} />
</div>

Or how about those ‚Äúmillennials‚Äù?

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={friendship_millennial} style={{width: "750px"}} />
</div>

## Using writing samples

Sometimes, you just love a piece of writing but don‚Äôt know the author. Well, you don‚Äôt need to. You can simply feed GPT a sample of the writing and it will generate the response according to that style. 
Simply add the sample to the prompt:
 
Write me a paragraph on the importance of friendship. Please write in this style: **[COPY & PASTE THE SAMPLE TEXT HERE. THE LONGER THE BETTER.]
USING YOUR OWN WRITING SAMPLE**
You can even feed your own writing sample so ChatGPT gives responses based on your writing style. The longer the sample, the better. 
Again, simply include it in your prompt:

Write me a paragraph on the importance of friendship. Please write in this style: **[COPY & PASTE YOUR OWN SAMPLE TEXT HERE. THE LONGER THE BETTER.]**

This will solve the issue of style consistency. If you want to come up with new articles made with ChatGPT and make them look and sound the old ones made manually by you, this is key. 


There‚Äôs still so much more depth and detail we can require from ChatGPT‚Äôs output, but this here will serve as a starting point for the absolute beginner.
