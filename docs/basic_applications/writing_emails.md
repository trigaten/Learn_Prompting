# 🟢 Writing An Email

Writing emails can be a time consuming task, especially when you need to read through an email you received first. This section will cover use cases ranging from a simple email telling your boss you are sick today to more complex cold lead emails.

## Basic Sick Day Email

Imagine that you wake up sick one day and can't go into work (or just don't want to 😈). Here is a simple prompt that writes an email to your boss telling them you are sick. 

<div trydyno-embed="" openai-model="text-davinci-003" initial-prompt="My Name: Mario\nBoss's name: John\n\nWrite an email to my boss saying that I will be out of office today since I am sick. " initial-response="Subject: Out of Office - Sick\n\nDear John,\n\nI am writing to inform you that I will be out of office today due to illness. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nI will be sure to keep you updated on my progress and will be back in the office as soon as I am feeling better.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nSincerely,\nMario" max-tokens="256" box-rows="8" model-temp="0" top-p="0">

</div>

This email works, but is pretty boring. Let's spice it up a bit!

## Style Modifiers/Instructions

It is very easy to modify the style of the email. For example, you can ask the AI to be 'humorous' or instruct it to 'Include a funny reason'.

<div trydyno-embed="" openai-model="text-davinci-003" initial-prompt="My Name: Mario\nBoss's name: John\n\nWrite a humorous yet professional email to my boss saying that I will be out of office today since I am sick. \nBe concise and funny. Include a funny reason:" initial-response="Dear John,\n\nI'm writing to let you know that I will be out of office today. I know I'm supposed to be working, but I just couldn't resist the call of the siren song of the local donut shop. I'm sure you understand.\n\nI'll be back in the office tomorrow and will make up the time.\n\nThanks,\nMario" max-tokens="256" box-rows="10" model-temp="0.7" top-p="1">

</div>
<br/>

Here is another example that is more serious/professional.

<div trydyno-embed="" openai-model="text-davinci-003" initial-prompt="My Name: Mario\nBoss's name: John\n\nWrite a **serious**, professional email to my boss saying that I will be out of office today since I am sick. \nBe concise:" initial-response="Subject: Out of Office - Sick\n\nDear John,\n\nI am writing to inform you that I will be out of office today due to illness. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nSincerely,\nMario" max-tokens="256" box-rows="8" model-temp="0" top-p="0">

## Responding to an Email

Imagine that you receive a long email from your boss with a lot of information. You need to respond to the email, but you don't have time to read through the entire thing. You can plug the email into an AI and ask it to `Generate a summary of this and a list of action items`.

<div trydyno-embed="" openai-model="text-davinci-003" initial-prompt="Dear Mario,\n\nI hope you're doing well. I am writing to provide you with some updates on our company and to request your assistance in addressing an issue with the user interface (UI) of the software you have been working on.\n\nAs you know, our company has been focusing on providing a user-friendly experience to our customers, and we have identified some issues with the UI of the software. Specifically, we have received feedback from our users that they are having difficulty accessing certain features, and that the UI is not intuitive enough.\n\nWe need your help to address these issues and make improvements to the UI of the software. This may involve making changes to the layout, design, or functionality of the UI. We believe that your expertise in software development and your familiarity with the software will make you the ideal person to help us with this task.\n\nIf you need any additional resources or support to complete this task, please do not hesitate to let me know. Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide me with an estimated timeline for when you expect these modifications to be completed.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nThank you for your hard work and dedication to our company. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\n\nGenerate a summary of this and a list of action items." initial-response="Summary: John is requesting Mario's assistance in addressing user interface issues with the software Mario has been working on. The issues involve difficulty accessing certain features and the UI not being intuitive enough. Mario's expertise in software development and familiarity with the software make him the ideal person to help with this task.\n\nAction Items:\n- Make changes to the layout, design, or functionality of the UI\n- Request additional resources or support if needed\n- Provide an estimated timeline for completion of modifications" max-tokens="256" box-rows="18" model-temp="0" top-p="0">
    <noscript>Failed to load Dyno Embed: JavaScript must be enabled</noscript>
</div>

<br/>You can then use this summary to write a response email.

<div trydyno-embed="" openai-model="text-davinci-003" initial-prompt="Summary: John is requesting Mario's assistance in addressing user interface issues with the software Mario has been working on. The issues involve difficulty accessing certain features and the UI not being intuitive enough. Mario's expertise in software development and familiarity with the software make him the ideal person to help with this task.\n\nAction Items:\n- Make changes to the layout, design, or functionality of the UI\n- Request additional resources or support if needed\n- Provide an estimated timeline for completion of modifications\n\nWrite a response email from Mario using the above email summary:" initial-response="Dear John,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me about the user interface issues with the software I have been working on. I understand the importance of making sure the UI is intuitive and easy to use, and I am happy to help.\n\nI will begin making changes to the layout, design, and functionality of the UI to address the issues you have mentioned. If I need additional resources or support, I will let you know. I will also provide an estimated timeline for completion of the modifications.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nSincerely,\nMario" max-tokens="256" box-rows="18" model-temp="0" top-p="0">

<br/>Note that you can often combine these two steps into one. You can ask the AI to generate a response email directly from the email you received.

## Cold Emails

Cold emails are emails sent to people that you don't know. It is difficult to get a response from cold emails, so it can be helpful to send out a lot of personally customized emails. Let's see how to do that with GPT-3(@bonta2022how).

<div trydyno-embed="" openai-model="text-davinci-003" initial-prompt="Company name: Bark Inc\nMy name: Mike\nWrite a cold outreach email" initial-response="Dear John,\n\nI'm writing to let you know that I will be out of office today. I know I'm supposed to be working, but I just couldn't resist the call of the siren song of the local donut shop. I'm sure you understand.\n\nI'll be back in the office tomorrow and will make up the time.\n\nThanks,\nZach" max-tokens="256" box-rows="10" model-temp="0" top-p="0">

</div>

This is neat, but we can do better. Let's add some more information to the prompt.

### Using unstructured information

Say you have the linkedin profile of the person you are sending the email to. You can add that information to the prompt to make the email more personalized. Let's use the [founder of Strive's LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/snpranav/) as an example. We'll copy a bunch of information from his profile and add it to the prompt.

It is super useful that LLMs can cut through the clutter of all the information we copied from LinkedIn. This cold outreach process can also be automated at a larger scale by scraping LinkedIn for relevant information.


## Conclusion

LLMs can help you write emails! Make sure you read what they write before sending it 😉
