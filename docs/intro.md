# Welcome

Welcome to this course on Prompt Engineering! 

I like to think of Prompt Engineering (PE) as "**How communicate with AI to get it to do what you want**". 

With many of the recent advances in AI,
this has become a particularly important skill.
This course focuses on applied prompt engineering techniques. Minimal knowledge of 
machine learning is expected.

## The single most important part of this course is your feedback!
If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please make an **[issue](https://github.com/trigaten/Learn_Prompting/issues/new/choose)**, email me at learnprompting@gmail.com, or reach out over [Discord](https://learnprompting.org/discord)/[Twitter](https://twitter.com/learn_prompting).

Even the smallest amount of feedback is very helpful!

## Course Philosophy

**Quick Iterations** - Since new PE content is published almost daily, 
I will update this course frequently with short articles about new techniques.
Let me know what you want to hear more about!

Part of this philosophy is **error iteration**; if you ever see something that you
don't quite understand, even something small, that's on me. **Please make an [issue](https://github.com/trigaten/Learn_Prompting/issues/new/choose)**!

**Focus on Practicality** - I will focus on applied, practical techniques that you can use
immediatly for your applications.

**Examples ASAP** - I try to put examples in the articles as soon as possible,
so that you can get a feel for the techniques as soon as possible.

I'll philosophize more about this when I have time to 😊

## How to read

It is not necessary to read all chapters in order. Read what interests you!

That being said, Basics is a good place to start,
and it discusses some very simple, but powerful, prompt engineering techniques.

## Chapters

Here is a quick summary of each chapter:

**Basics**: Intro to PE and simple PE techniques

**Advanced Applications**: Some very powerful, but more advanced applications of PE

**Applied Prompting**: Some complete walkthroughs of the PE process written by community members

**Reliability**: How to make LLMs more reliable

**Images**: PE for text to image models like DALLE and Stable Diffusion!

**Prompt Injection**: Hacking, but for PE

**Prompting IDEs**: Different PE tools

**Prompt Tuning**: Fine tune prompts with gradients
