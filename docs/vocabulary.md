# ðŸ“™ Vocabulary Reference

Please refer to this page for a list of terms and concepts that we will use throughout this course.

#### Large Language Models (LLMs), Pretrained Language Models (PLMs)(@branch2022evaluating), Language Models (LMs), and foundation models

These terms all refer more or less to the same thing: large AIs (neural networks), which have usually been trained 
on a huge amount of text.

#### Masked Language Models (MLMs)

MLMs are a type of NLP model, which have a special token, usually `[MASK]`, which is
replaced with a word from the vocabulary. The model then predicts the word that
was masked. For example, if the sentence is "The dog is [MASK] the cat", the model
will predict "chasing" with high probability.

#### Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is the task of classifying text into positive, negative, or other sentiments. 

#### "Model" vs. "AI" vs. "LLM"

These terms are used somewhat interchangeably throughout this course, but they do
not always mean the same thing. LLMs are a type of AI, as noted above, but not all AIs are LLMs.
When we mentioned models in this course, we are referring to AI models. As such, in this course,
you can consider the terms "model" and "AI" to be interchangeable.

#### Verbalizer

In the classification setting, verbalizers are mappings from labels to words in
a language model's vocabulary(@schick2020exploiting). For example, consider 
performing sentiment classification with the following prompt:

```text
Tweet: "I love hotpockets"
What is the sentiment of this tweet? Say 'pos' or 'neg'.
```

Here, the verbalizer is the mapping from the conceptual labels of `positive` and `negative` to the tokens `pos` and `neg`.
