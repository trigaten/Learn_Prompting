# ðŸŸ¢ Weighted Terms

Some models (Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, etc.) allow you to weight terms in a prompt. This can be used to emphasize certain words or phrases in the generated image. It can 
also be used to de-emphasize certain words or phrases in the generated image. Let's consider a simple example:

import mountains from '@site/docs/assets/images_chapter/mountains.webp';
import mountains_no_trees from '@site/docs/assets/images_chapter/mountains_no_trees.webp';
import planets from '@site/docs/assets/images_chapter/planets.webp';


# Example

Here are a few mountains generated by Stable Diffusion, with the prompt `mountain`.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={mountains} style={{width: "350px"}}/>
</div>

However, if we want mountains without trees, we can use the prompt `mountain | tree:-10`. Since we weighted tree very negatively, they do not appear in the generated image.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <LazyLoadImage src={mountains_no_trees} style={{width: "350px"}} />
</div>

Weighted terms can be combined into more complicated prompts, like 
`A planet in space:10 | bursting with color red, blue, and purple:4 | aliens:-10 | 4K, high quality`

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <LazyLoadImage src={planets} style={{width: "350px"}} />
</div>
