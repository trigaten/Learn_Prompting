# ðŸŸ¡ Multimodal CoT

You've seen chain of thought used with text, but can it be used to answer questions about images? The answer is yes! This is called multimodal chain of thought (i.e. there are 2 modalities involved, text *and* image). The process is similar to the text version, but there are some differences.

import multimodal_cot from '../assets/multimodal_cot.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={multimodal_cot} style={{width: "500px"}} />
</div>
