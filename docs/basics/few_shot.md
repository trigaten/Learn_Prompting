## Few Shot Standard Prompts

Few shot standard prompts(@liu2021pretrain) are just standard prompts that have _exemplars_
in them. Exemplars are examples of the task that the prompt is trying to solve, 
which are included in the prompt itself (@brown2020language). In research, few shot standard prompts 
are sometimes referred to simply as standard prompts (though we attempt not to do so in this guide).

### Two examples of few shot standard prompts:

_Few Shot Standard Prompt_

```
What is the capital of Spain?
Madrid
What is the capital of Italy?
Rome
What is the capital of France?
```

_Few Shot Standard Prompt in QA format_

Q: What is the capital of Spain?
A: Madrid
Q: What is the capital of Italy?

Q: What is the capital of France?

Few shot prompts facilitate "few shot" AKA "in context" learning, which is the 
ability to learn without parameter updates(@zhao2021calibrate).
