OpenAI provides another interface, besides ChatGPT, for prompting. It is called OpenAI Playground, and gives you more control over how the AI responds. 

## Get Set Up

- Go to [http://platform.openai.com](http://platform.openai.com)
- Sign in

## The Interface

The interface appears complex, with many drop down boxes that configure the interface.

Personally, I use this. If you are intersted in other prompt engineering IDEs, checkout link.
