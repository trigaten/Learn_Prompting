Thus far, this course has mostly used [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com). ChatGPT is a chatbot, which means it remembers previous messages that you sent it, so that you can have a conversation. Chat bots are not the only type of %%LLM|LLM%%. For example, an earlier AI developed by OpenAI, GPT-3, is a LLM that has no memory. GPT-3 and ChatGPT can perform the same basics tasks, like answering questions and generating summaries, so why have a non-chat AI?

Non-chat Gen AIs are precursors to Chat Gen AIs. Most major AI companies producing LLMs seem focused on chatbots.
