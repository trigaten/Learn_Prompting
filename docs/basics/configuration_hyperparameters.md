# Introduction

The output of LLMs can be affected by *configuration hyperparameters*, which control various aspects of the model, such as how 'random' it is. These hyperparameters can be adjusted to produce more creative, diverse, and interesting output. In this section, we will discuss two important configuration hyperparameters and how they affect the output of LLMs.

:::note
[for researchers] These are different from regular hyperparameters like learning rate, number of layers, hidden size, etc.

## Temperature

Temperature is a configuration hyperparameter that controls the randomness of language model output. A high temperature produces more unpredictable and creative results, while a low temperature produces more common and conservative output. For example, if you adjust the temperature to 0.5, the model will usually generate text that is more predictable and less creative than if you set the temperature to 1.0.

## Top p

Top p, also known as nucleus sampling, is another configuration hyperparameter that controls the randomness of language model output. It sets a threshold probability and selects the top tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold. The model then randomly samples from this set of tokens to generate output. This method can produce more diverse and interesting output than traditional methods that randomly sample the entire vocabulary. For example, if you set top p to 0.9, the model will only consider the most likely words that make up 90% of the probability mass.

## Other relevant hyperparameters

There are many other hyperparameters that can affect language model performance, such as frequency and presence penalties. We do not cover them here, but perhaps will in the future.

## How these hyperparameters affect the output

Temperature and top p can both affect the output of a language model by controlling the degree of randomness and diversity in the generated text. A high temperature or top p value produces more unpredictable and interesting results, but also increases the likelihood of errors or nonsense text. A low temperature or top p value can produce more conservative and predictable results, but may also result in repetitive or uninteresting text.

For text generation tasks, you may want to use a high temperature or top p value. However, for tasks where accuracy is important, such as translation tasks or question answering, a low temperature or top p value should be used to improve accuracy and factual correctness.

:::note
Sometimes more randomness can be helpful on tasks where accuracy is necessary when paired with [special prompting techniques](https://learnprompting.org/docs/intermediate/self_consistency).

## Conclusion

In summary, temperature, top p, and other model configuration hyperparameters are key factors to consider when working with language models. By understanding the relationship between these hyperparameters and the model output, practitioners can optimize their prompts for specific tasks and applications.

:::warning
Some models, like ChatGPT, **don't** let you adjust these configuration hyperparameters (unless you use the API).
