## GPT-4

GPT-4(@openai2023gpt4) is the next LLM in OpenAI's GPT series. It improves upon GPT-3 in a number of ways, including better reasoning and longer context length. Currently, we do not directly cover it in this course since 1) not everyone has access to it yet and 2) most of the prompting strategies we cover in this website work for GPT-4 as well. We encourage you to read the [OpenAI page](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) on GPT-4 for more details.
