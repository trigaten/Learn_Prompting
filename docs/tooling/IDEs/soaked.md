## Features

Soaked provides a graphical interface for chaining prompts together, 
where you can easily see how different components flow together. It also 
provides a lower level prompt view with the option to generate multiple
completions at once. It also provides a cost estimate for completions. It currently supports GPT3 and requires an OpenAI key to use.
