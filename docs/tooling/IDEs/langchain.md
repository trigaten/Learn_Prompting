that provides various functionality for building and chaining prompts.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={Image} style={{width: "750px"}}/>
</div>

## Features

LangChain allows for easy provider switching, standardizes interactions with LLMs,
and provides _agents_ for things like symbolic reasoning and MRKL architectures(@karpas2022mrkl).

LangChain plans to add a graphical user interface in the future.
