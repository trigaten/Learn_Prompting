# Promptmetheus

[Promptmetheus](https://promptmetheus.com) helps you compose, test, and evaluate one-shot prompts for the OpenAI platform that predictably transform input to output.

## Features

In the Promptmetheus playground you can compose prompts from individual blocks and test prompt variations with different model parameters. You can rate the different outputs and get visualizations for how each block performs. Prompts and outputs can easily be exported to .csv, .xls, and .json files.
