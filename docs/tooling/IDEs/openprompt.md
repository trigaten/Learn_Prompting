[OpenPrompt](https://thunlp.github.io/OpenPrompt/index.html) is a Python library
that provides various functionality for building and testing prompts.

</div>

## Features

OpenPrompt supports models from huggingface, but not yet OpenAI. It focuses more
on datasets and testing than chaining. OpenPrompt also appears to support 
soft-prompting via https://github.com/thunlp/OpenDelta.
