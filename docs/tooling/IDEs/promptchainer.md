# PromptChainer

[PromptChainer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.06566.pdf)(@wu2022promptchainer) is a research tool for prompt engineering. It focuses on chaining prompts together, and is the most
refined research IDE that I have found.

## Features

PromptChainer has a chain view, as well as an individual node view. They also 
provide debugging features.
