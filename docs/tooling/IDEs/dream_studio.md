# Dream Studio

[Dream Studio](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream) is a website for generating images with Stable Diffusion,
a text to image model.

import Image from '@site/docs/assets/tooling/dreamstudio.webp';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={Image} style={{width: "750px"}}/>
</div>

## Features

Dream studio's main feature is the ability to adjust various configuration parameters
of the model, such as height/width of the generated image and steps/sampling algorithm. It allows for in/outpainting.

It currently has an underdeveloped history view (it appears to save pixelated versions of the images to a browser cache, but there is no way to view them).
