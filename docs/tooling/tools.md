# Prompt Engineering Tools

This section contains a list of non-IDE tools that are useful for prompting.

## Prompt Development, Testing, and Chaining

### [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/)

> Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. But using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to create a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

> This library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications.

### [Dust.tt](https://dust.tt)

> The Dust platform helps build large language model applications as a series of prompted calls
to external models. It provides an easy to use graphical UI to build chains of prompts, as well as a set of standard blocks and a custom programming language to parse and process language model outputs.

> It provides a series of features to make development of applications faster,
easier and more robust:
- running multiple completions in parallel
- inspecting execution outputs
- versioning prompt chains 
- custom programming language to process data and text
- API integration for various models and external services

### [OpenPrompt](https://thunlp.github.io/OpenPrompt/)(@ding2021openprompt)

> Prompt-learning is the latest paradigm to adapt pre-trained language models (PLMs) to downstream NLP tasks, which modifies the input text with a textual template and directly uses PLMs to conduct pre-trained tasks. OpenPrompt is a library built upon PyTorch and provides a standard, flexible and extensible framework to deploy the prompt-learning pipeline. OpenPrompt supports loading PLMs directly from huggingface transformers. In the future, we will also support PLMs implemented by other libraries.

### [BetterPrompt](https://github.com/stjordanis/betterprompt)

> ⚡ Test suite for LLM prompts before pushing them to PROD ⚡

### [Prompt Engine](https://github.com/microsoft/prompt-engine)

> NPM utility library for creating and maintaining prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs).

### [Promptify](https://github.com/promptslab/Promptify)

> Relying solely on LLMs is often insufficient to build applications & tools. To unlock their full potential, it's necessary to integrate LLMs with other sources of computation or knowledge and get the pipeline ready for production.

> This library is aimed at assisting in developing a pipeline for using LLMs APIs in production, solving NLP Tasks such as NER, Classification, Question, Answering, Summarization, Text2Graph etc. and providing powerful agents for building chat agents for different tasks.


### [TextBox](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/TextBox)(@tang2022textbox)

> TextBox 2.0 is an up-to-date text generation library based on Python and PyTorch focusing on building a unified and standardized pipeline for applying pre-trained language models to text generation:

### [ThoughtSource](https://github.com/OpenBioLink/ThoughtSource)

> "ThoughtSource is a central, open resource and community centered on data and tools for chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models (Wei 2022). Our long-term goal is to enable trustworthy and robust reasoning in advanced AI systems for driving scientific research and medical practice."

## Misc.

### [GPT Index](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)(@Liu_GPT_Index_2022)

> GPT Index is a project consisting of a set of data structures designed to make it easier to use large external knowledge bases with LLMs

### [Deforum](https://github.com/HelixNGC7293/DeforumStableDiffusionLocal)

### [Visual Prompt Builder](https://tools.saxifrage.xyz/prompt)

Build prompts, visually

### [Interactive Composition Explorer](https://github.com/oughtinc/ice)

> ICE is a Python library and trace visualizer for language model programs.

### [PTPT - Prompt To Plain Text](https://github.com/LeslieLeung/PTPT)

> PTPT is an command-line tool that allows you to easily convert plain text files using pre-defined prompts with the help of ChatGPT. With PTPT, you can effortlessly create and share prompt formats, making collaboration and customization a breeze. Plus, by subscribing, you gain access to even more prompts to enhance your experience. If you're interested in prompt engineering, you can use PTPT to develop and share your prompts.

### [Orquesta AI Prompts](https://orquesta.cloud/platform/ai-llm-prompts)

> Low-code collaboration platform for AI Prompts

- Full prompt lifecycle management (from ideation to feedback collection)
- Enterprise-grade features and security
- Support for public, private, and custom LLMs
- Prompts based on custom context and business rules. Evaluations on the Edge
